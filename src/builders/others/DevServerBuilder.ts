      // https://medium.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server-middleware-security-issues-1489d950874a

      // While we're investigating better solutions, for now we will take a
      // compromise. Since our WDS configuration only serves files in the `public`
      // folder we won't consider accessing them a vulnerability. However, if you
      // use the `proxy` feature, it gets more dangerous because it can expose
      // remote code execution vulnerabilities in backends like Django and Rails.
      // So we will disable the host check normally, but enable it if you have
      // specified the `proxy` setting. Finally, we let you override it if you
      // really know what you're doing with a special environment variable.

      // production build folder unless we copy them. However, copying the whole
      // project directory is dangerous because we may expose sensitive files.
      // Instead, we establish a convention that only files in `public` directory
      // get served. Our build script will copy `public` into the `build` folder.
